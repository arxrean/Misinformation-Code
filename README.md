# Misinformation-Code
Unofficial implementation of (multi-modal) misinformation papers. Please note there may be some changes in the code for the use of the models in real cases. If you are working on research papers, please refer to the official implementations for fair comparison. 

* `mvae.py`: Multimodal Generative Models for Scalable Weakly-Supervised Learning
* [EANN](https://github.com/yaqingwang/EANN-KDD18): EANN: Event Adversarial Neural Networks for Multi-Modal Fake News Detection
* `spotfake.py`: SpotFake: A Multi-modal Framework for Fake News Detection
* `btic.py`: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Unreliable News Detection in COVID-19 Pandemic. No contrastive loss due to the lack of timestamp label
